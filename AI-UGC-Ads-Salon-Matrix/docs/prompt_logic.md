- UGC ads were chosen because they build trust through relatability and authenticity.
- The master prompt defines role, context, constraints, and structured output.
- Variation prompts isolate specific ad elements such as hooks, platforms, and offers.
- Platform adaptation ensures content matches viewer behavior on YouTube Shorts.
- Offer-based prompts introduce urgency without sounding promotional.
